## Description
 Fashionista is a Fashion organizing application that allows users to create outfits and collections in many different ways.
The application has a modern ui that allows users to fashion easier and faster. Users can import their clothes and create outfits and collections, use AI or libraries for custom clothing. 
## Motivation
The motivation for this project actually came when I was deciding what to dress in and forgetting what went well together.
Looking for apps on the web and app store I found that not many made this type of app and most that existed were beyond old.
The solution for me was to create a fashion app that allowed for creating outfits and improve a users fashion taste.
The goal for this application is to allow users to organize their clothing to make outfits they are confident in and increase fashion prowess.

- ```Git clone https://github.com/Jruz9/fashionista.git```
